#Data Structures
This file contains sample code from various data structures included singly linked lists.

##Singly Linked List

The linked_list file contains an example of a singly linked array.

##Queue

The queue demonstrates the first-in-first-out method of accessing a list.

##Stack

The stack demonstrated the last-in-first-out method of accessing a list with last an example of a browsing history going back and forward through previously viewed websites.

##Binary Tree

The binary tree is a tree of managers with two employees who they manage and the employees that those employees manage. There are three methods that traverse through the tree in pre order, in order, and in post order.

##Merge Sort

The merge_sort breaks down the list into single units. It then continues to compare and merge the left unit to the unit to it's right until there is just one array of sorted numbers.
